        So, you want to know more about me? I'm flattered!
        Apart from being a web developer, I do many things!
        I am a private pilot in Canada, avid aviation enthusiast,
        love building and flying small quadcopters, cycling, 
        hiking, cosplaying, attending conventions, among more!

    <h3>A little more about my pilot stuff :)</h3>

        Before I mentioned I'm a private pilot. Here's a little
        more about that. My aviation journey began when I was
        13 in the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, where I had an
        Air Experience Flight in a Grob Tutor. After having looked
        skyward for the majority of my life, having experienced that
        Air Experience Flight left me with a desire to fly.

        In December of 2019, I was awarded for my efforts 
        in aviation specifically in the Royal Air Force Air
        Cadets, with a 12 hour fully funded flying
        scholarship in Dundee, Scotland. Having had to deal 
        with the delays of COVID-19, I did not complete 
        the scholarship until early August. Below is the 
        aircraft I flew!
